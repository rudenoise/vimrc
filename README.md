# The rudenoise vimrc project

Trying to keep my use of neovim convenient (language servers etc...) but
minimal (netrw for file browsing etc...).

Language Servers:

Those based on NodeJS:
```sh
npm install -g pyright bash-language-server yaml-language-server
```

Those based on python:
```sh
pip install ruff-lsp
```
